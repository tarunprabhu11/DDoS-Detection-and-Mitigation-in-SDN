 Traditional network management is cumbersome, requiring manual
 configuration for each device. This makes it challenging to maintain secu
rity and overall network health. Software-defined networking (SDN) tack
les this issue by separating the control plane, which dictates traffic flow,
 from the data plane, responsible for actual traffic forwarding. This sep
aration unlocks several benefits: centralized network management, sim
plified automation through programming, and enhanced security through
 network-wide policy implementation. However, SDN networks are still
 vulnerable, particularly to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks
 that flood the network with traffic, hindering legitimate user access.This
 paper proposes a solution for SDN environments, where DDoS attacks are
 prevalent. The method combines statistical analysis to pinpoint abnormal traffic patterns with deep learning for automated attack detection and
 mitigation. This approach, tested with an SDN controller and network
 simulator, achieved a 99.75% accuracy rate in identifying DDoS attacks
 detection rate. Upon attack detection, the system automatically blocks
 malicious traffic, safeguarding the network.
